This document is about all science fairs that this project competes with other amazing projects and my personal experiences on them. This project has gone through the [Albert College](https://www.albertcollege.ca/) Science Fair, [The Quinte Regional Science and Technology Fair(QRSTF)](http://www.qrstf.ca/), and [The Canda-Wide Science Fair(CWSF)](https://cwsf.youthscience.ca/).
