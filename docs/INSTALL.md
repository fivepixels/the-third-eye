# INSTALLATION

In this document, I will walk you through how to use this extension on your computer locally since this extension could not have been published to the Chrome Web Store, very unfortunately.

## HOW TO INSTALL

#### 1. Clone this project

  2. Unzipping

#### 2. Change to Developer Mode

If you are done following through the first step, what you have to do is to let Google Chrome know that the installed path is the path that Google should reference, making an extension locally.

First, you have to go to [the secure chrome page for extensions](chrome://extension), which is `chrome://extension`, and turn on the developer mode.
