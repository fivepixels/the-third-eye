## The Third Eye - the new approach for Blind People to Navigate Websites

### Introduction

The Third Eye is a science fair project for which I built a [Google Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions) that helps Blind People not only understand the context of pages but also interact with them so they can benefit from the world of informationâ€”the Internet. What makes this project even more shine is its optimization for the diverse types of blindness that exist and well incorporation between real problems and AIs. It is responsible for people who have a problem with three types of blindness: Colour Blindness, Partial Blindness, and Bluriness and differentiated features will be provided for each type of blindness. And people who cannot see the details(partial and blurriness) would get help from AIs that are provided by [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
